    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
       Physics Graduate | Experimenter | Intern @ Phoenix Medical Systems Currently exploring the world of medical technology as an intern at Phoenix Medical Systems, where I’m working end-to-end on a full project — from concept to proof of concept (PoC). After completing my B.Sc. in Physics (2022–25), I’m now continuing in the same college for my M.Sc., while also extending my internship to keep building and learning. I’ve developed good skills in Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, VPython, Pandas) and spent extensive time in experimental labs and complemented this hands-on experience and knowledge by building a Python-based website and experimenting with nanoparticle synthesis as mini project. I even dabbled in algorithmic trading, creating a simple yet functional trading algorithm using moving averages and expanding it with exponential averaging — purely out of curiosity and a drive to learn, while collaborating with a friend from B.Sc. Economics. I enjoy blending science with technology and stay curious about emerging fields. Lately, I’ve been building a foundational understanding of optical diffusers and probabilistic simulations through literature surveys and research papers, with the goal of applying this knowledge to real-world problem-solving in the future. A recent milestone: Our team won 1st place in the DIR-V Symposium (Product Track) for an innovative hardware at IIT Madras. Next up: I’m excited to keep building at the intersection of physics and innovation as I begin my M.Sc. journey and continue contributing at Phoenix.

      <h3>Reflector Design for neonatal industry</h3>
      <p>The IncuWarmer reflector uses a segmented parabolic profile to evenly distribute infrared heat across the infant bed without placing the heater directly overhead. Each reflector segment is carefully angled to compensate for heat loss and ensure uniform warmth. A hyperbolic profile was also explored for a more compact, continuous design with improved heat spread.</p>
