    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Physics Graduate | Experimenter | Intern @ Phoenix Medical Systems<p>

    <p>Currently exploring the world of medical technology as an intern at Phoenix Medical Systems, where I’m working end-to-end on a full project — from concept to proof of concept (PoC).</p>

    <p>After completing my B.Sc. in Physics (2022–25), I’ve continued on to pursue my M.Sc., while also extending my internship to keep building and learning.</p>

    <p>I’ve developed strong skills in Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, VPython, Pandas, Flask) and spent extensive time in experimental labs. I’ve complemented that hands-on experience by building a Python-based website and synthesizing silver nanoparticle  as a mini-project.</p>

    <p>Out of curiosity and a drive to learn, I also dabbled in algorithmic trading — creating a simple, functional trading algorithm using moving averages and expanding it with exponential averaging — in collaboration with a friend from B.Sc. Economics.</p>

    <p>I enjoy blending science with technology and remain curious about emerging fields, especially BioPhotonics. Recently, I’ve been building a foundational understanding of optical diffusers and probabilistic simulations through literature surveys and research papers, with the goal of applying this knowledge to solve real-world problems in the future.</p>

    <p>A recent milestone: Our team won 1st place in the DIR-V Symposium (Product Track) at IIT Madras for an innovative hardware project.</p>

    <p>Next up: I’m excited to keep building at the intersection of physics and innovation as I begin my M.Sc. journey.</p>

      <h3>Reflector Design for neonatal industry</h3>
      <p>The IncuWarmer reflector uses a segmented parabolic profile to evenly distribute infrared heat across the infant bed without placing the heater directly overhead. Each reflector segment is carefully angled to compensate for heat loss and ensure uniform warmth. A hyperbolic profile was also explored for a more compact, continuous design with improved heat spread.</p>

      <h3>Synthesis of Silver Nanoparticles</h3>
      <p>Synthesized SILVER nanoparticles under 100 nm using chemical method.<br> 

Synthesis of silver nanoparticles is crucial due to their unique antimicrobial, optical, and catalytic properties. These nanoparticles are widely used in medicine, electronics, and environmental applications, offering innovative solutions like targeted drug delivery, improved sensors, and water purification. Their small size and high surface area enhance reactivity, making them essential in advancing nanotechnology and materials science.
